# this awk script mangles makedepend output for a single object file
# usage:
# awk -f .../processdeps.awk \
#     -v OUTDIR=outdir \
#     -v SRCDIR=srcdir \
#     -v WORKDIR=workdir \
#     -v REPODIR=repodir \
#     -v OBJECTFILE=objectfile
# called like this the script will read from stdin
# and write to stdout. It will:
#  - replace the objectfile with the one given on the commandline
#  - normalize paths to mixed paths (replacing all \ with /)
#  - replace the string given as WORKDIR with $(WORKDIR)/
#  - replace the string given as OUTDIR with $(OUTDIR)/
#  - replace the string given as SRCDIR with $(SRCDIR)/
#  - replace the string given as REPODIR with $(REPODIR)/
#  - translates absolute mixed windows paths to cygwin paths by
#    substituting a path starting with X:... to /cygdrive/X/...
