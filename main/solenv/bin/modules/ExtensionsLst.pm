=head1 NAME

    ExtensionLst.pm - Functionality for the interpretation of the main/extensions.lst file.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    For downloading extensions during build setup:
    
    use ExtensionsLst;
    ExtensionsLst::DownloadExtensions();

    For including extensions into the pack set:

    use ExtensionsLst;
    ExtensionsLst::GetExtensionList(@language_list);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

    The contents of the extensions.lst file are used at two times in
    the process of building pack sets.

    Once at the beginning right after configure is run the
    DownloadExtensions() function determines the list of extensions
    that are not present locally and downloads them.
    
    The second time is after all modules are built (and the locally
    built extensions are present) and the pack sets are created.  For
    every language (or sets of lanugages) a set of extensions is
    collected and included into the pack set. 

    The content of the extensions.lst file is ignored when the --with-extensions option is given to configure.

# Number of the line in extensions.lst that is currently being processed.
my $LineNo = 0;

# Set to 1 to get a more verbose output, the default is 0.
my $Debug = 0;


=head3 Prepare
    Check that some environment variables are properly set and then return the file name
    of the 'extensions.lst' file, typically located in main/ beside 'ooo.lst'.

=head 3 EvaluateOperator
    Evaluate a single test statement like 'language = en.*'.
    Special handling for operators '=', '==', and 'eq' which are all mapped to '=~'.
    Therefore the right hand side may be a perl regexp.  It is prefixed with '^'.

    Other operators are at the moment only supported in the way that they are evaluated via eval().

    my ($left,$operator,$right) = @_;

    }
    else

    }

    return $result;
}




=head EvaluateTerm
    Evaluate a string that contains a simple test term of the form
    left operator right
    with arbitrary spacing allowed around and between the three parts.

    The left hand side is specially handled:
    
    - When the left hand side is 'language' then it is replaced by
    any of the given languages in turn.  When the term evaluates to true for any of the languages then
    true is returned.  False is returned only when none of the given languages matches.

    - When the left hand side consists only of upper case letters, digits, and '_' then it is
    interpreted as the name of a environment variable.  It is replaced by its value before the term
    is evaluated.

    - Any other left hand side is an error (at the moment.)

    Check that the given line contains an optional MD5 sum followed by

    followed by an optional file name (which is necessary when it is not the last part of the URL.)
    Return an array that contains the protocol, the name, the original
    URL, and the MD5 sum from the beginning of the line.
    The name of the URL depends on its protocol:
    - for http(s) the part of the URL after the last '/'.
    - for file URLS it is everything after the protocol://

    Parse the extensions.lst file.

    Lines that contain only spaces or comments or are empty are
    ignored.

    Lines that contain a selector, ie a test enclosed in brackets, are
    evaluated.  The following lines, until the next selector, are
    ignored when the selector evaluates to false.  When an empty list
    of languages is given then any 'language=...' test is evaluated as
    true.

    All other lines are expected to contain a URL optionally preceded
    by an MD5 sum.

=head3 Download
    Download a set of files that are specified via URLs.

    File URLs are ignored here because they point to extensions that have not yet been built.

    For http URLs there may be an optional MD5 checksum.  If it is present then downloaded
    files that do not match that checksum are an error and lead to abortion of the current process.
    Files that have already been downloaded are not downloaded again.

          sets due to legal reasons. They are installed on first start
          of the office.
          File URLs reference extensions whose source code is part of
          the repository.  They are pre-registered when installation
          sets are created.  Their installation is finished when the
          office is first started.
