        	This is an Activity interface implementation for intrinsic

        	animations directly within a shape, e.g. drawing layer
        	animations, or GIF animations.

            Common slideshow objects

            Shape to control the intrinsic animation for

            @param rWakeupEvent
            Externally generated wakeup event, to set this
            activity to sleep during inter-frame intervals. Must
            come from the outside, since wakeup event and this
            object have mutual references to each other.

            @param rTimeouts
            Vector of timeout values, to wait before the next
            frame is shown.
