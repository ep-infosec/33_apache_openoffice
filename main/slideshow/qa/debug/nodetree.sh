#  Generate node tree from verbose logfile
#
#  HOWTO USE
#  =========
#
#  First of all, you need to recompile modules slideshow and canvas
#  with VERBOSE=t set in the environment, and debug=t defined at the
#  build tool command line. Then run your slideshow and redirect stdout
#  to a file. 
#
#  Then, call 'nodetree.sh trace-file > tree.ps' to generate a
#  PostScript file for the AnimationNode tree generated during the show.
#  Since these easily get pretty huge, use only one page, and try to 
#  limit the slide content (which have effects assigned, that is) to 
#  the bare minimum (to reproduce your bug, or whatever you need this
#  for).
#
#  The generated output will have all nodes color-coded with their state 
#  at the point when the tree was dumped (see colors.sh for the color 
#  codes)
#
#  When looking for the mechanics that generate the relevant output, 
#  grep for the DEBUG_NODES_SHOWTREE macros in the slideshow source:
#  Each such place dumps the current node tree to the trace output. Thus,
#  if you need to check the tree state at other places or times, just add
#  a DEBUG_NODES_SHOWTREE (or DEBUG_NODES_SHOWTREE_WITHIN, that is).
