<title>org.openoffice.xmerge.converter.xml.sxc.minicalc package</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="white">

<p>Provides the tools for doing the conversion of StarWriter XML to
and from MiniCalc format.</p>

<p>It follows the {@link org.openoffice.xmerge} framework for the conversion process.</p>

<p>Since it converts to/from a Palm application format, these converters
follow the <a href=../../../../converter/palm/package-summary.html#streamformat>
PalmDB stream format</a> for writing out to the Palm sync client or reading
in from the Palm sync client.</p>

<p>Note that <code>PluginFactoryImpl</code> also provides a
<code>DocumentMerger</code> object, i.e. {@link org.openoffice.xmerge.converter.xml.sxw.aportisdoc.DocumentMergerImpl DocumentMergerImpl}.
This functionality was derived from its superclass
{@link org.openoffice.xmerge.converter.xml.sxw.SxwPluginFactory SxwPluginFactory}.</p>
