Notes on API wrapper pieces ...

SvxZoomDialog::SvxZoomDialog( Window* pParent, const SfxItemSet& rCoreSet ) :
	Dialog( pParent, SVX_RES( RID_SVXDLG_ZOOM ) ),

What do we do ?
	+ lots of potential VCL/Svx/Sfx etc. top-levels ...

	+ Create the window & the 1st member: 'FooHandle' ?
	    + Multiply inherited ?
	+ object from where ?

	+ Default:
	    + a pseudo-Dialog / wrapper ...
	    + load using layout (etc.)
		+ register an SID table ?
		    + necessary ?
		+ SIDs ? - post it ...


	+ [ Otherwise ... hook up via a helper /
	    constructor member ... ]

* Fixed:
    + OKButton / CancelButton
	+ don't chain to PushButton::Click
	    + if there is no ClickHdl set ... [ !urgh! ...]

    * FIXME:
	other widgets ...
	* How do we cope ? *
	....
	    + priorities ? Layout ?
	    + de-coupling ?
	    + native widgets ?
	    + hmm...
	+ custom widgets ?
	    + 'OKButton' ... (?) :-)
	    + 'CancelButton'
	    + 'HelpButton' ...
	+ a VCL hack ...
	    + create an 'addLayout()' method ?
	    + [ like cl's ? ]
	+ implement this ...

** Lifecycle ?
    + how do we track the 'Impl'
      vs. the pImpl vs. (etc.)
	+ held by mutual references ?

    + pointer to the widget itself passed in ? 
	+ MI ?
    + when the widget dies - just NULL the
      listener's back-ptr ?

    + Locking [!?] - how / why / what / who ?
	+ urgh ...
	+ threading bits ...

    + SID table (?) ...
	+ [ necessary ? - just use the SID name as the XML attr ? ]
	+ LAYOUT_ID(a) -> "#a" - stringified ...

** FIXME:
    + we need a decent MetricField implementation
	+ it is more than a SpinField
	+ need to move the 'Border' property down (etc.)
	+ re-arrange the properties to be next to the impls.
	  in awt ...

    + fix the 

XCurrencyField (huh)
    needs implementing for VCLXMetricField (non-existent) ...
    copy the code from XCurrencyField ? make a sub-class there ?
